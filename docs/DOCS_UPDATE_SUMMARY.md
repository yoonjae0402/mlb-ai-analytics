# Documentation Updates

I have updated the documentation to match the project's new architecture (Google TTS, Gemini, etc.).

## Files Updated
- **USAGE_GUIDE.md**: Updated env vars, troubleshooting, and GitHub Actions.
- **QUICK_REFERENCE.md**: Updated commands, costs, and troubleshooting.
- **README.md**: Verifed user changes were consistent.

The project documentation is now fully synced.
